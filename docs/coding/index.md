# Coding practices

* Instead of writing a 'TODO' in the code or documentation, create an issue on GitHub. TODO's in code are less visible to the rest of the team.

The [standard-maintenance-scripts](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-maintenance-scripts) repository is used to enforce coding and formatting styles for Python, Markdown and JSON.

```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :glob:

   *

```
