# GitHub

The [open-contracting](https://github.com/open-contracting/) organization hosts all OCDS-related assets directly supported by the Open Contracting Partnership or its Helpdesks.

The [open-contracting-archive](https://github.com/open-contracting-archive/) organization hosts any assets that are no longer supported and are therefore archived.
