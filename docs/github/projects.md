# Projects

The [`open-contracting` organization](https://github.com/orgs/open-contracting/projects) and the [`ocds-show` repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-show/projects) have GitHub Projects, which are used to organize [sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)) in a [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) system.

We also have an [agile board](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/tech/agile/board) in the CRM. Its uses and features are somewhat distinct (e.g. time tracking) and complementary (e.g. long-term project management) to what GitHub offers.

GitHub Projects allows adding cards that are not attached to issues. People expect to have visibility of all of a repository's issues within the Issues tab, so cards should be used only to organize a sprint, not to document an issue requiring a fix.
