# Translation

To support wide adoption, the Open Contracting Data Standard schema, codelists and documentation can be translated from their canonical English language version.

Translations are maintained using Transifex.

This page describes the processes for translators.

The steps required to include translations in a documentation build are described in the [technical processes section](technical/index).

## Translation projects

There are a number ofOCDS related projects on transifex:

* [Standard 1.0](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-0/dashboard/)
* [Standard 1.1](transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/)
* [Standard Theme](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-theme/dashboard/) - containing the documentation theme
* [CoVE](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/cove/dashboard/) - containing the text for the the validator

## Languages

We currently actively maintain translations into:

* Spanish
* French

A number of other community translations exist in various levels of completion.

## Translators and reviewers

Details of the process for selecting translators and reviewers and managing permissions will be put here

## Using Transifex

### HowTo

ToDo - add a guidance here on how to use Transifex

### Translation glossary

A translation glossary is [available here](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/glossary/en/) (Change the language on the end of the URL to view the glossary in different languages).

This can also be accessed from within the translation editor

The glossary contains key technical terms in open contracting that must be translated carefully.

In our translation process, we encourage translators to:

* First populate the glossary with suggested translations for these terms;
* Validate these translations with your nominated reviewer;
* Then commence on further translation;

### What not to translate

Some of the text from codelists originates from other projects, so should probably be translated by the original projects, not OCDS.

These are marked with the ‘should_be_translated_upstream’ tag. This gives them a little tag icon next to them.
