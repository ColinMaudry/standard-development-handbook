# Translation

To support wide adoption, the Open Contracting Data Standard schema, codelists and documentation can be translated from their canonical English language version. Translations are maintained using Transifex.

This page describes the processes for translators. The steps required to include translations in a documentation build are described in the [technical processes section](technical/index).

## Translation projects

There are a number of OCDS related projects on Transifex:

* [Standard 1.0](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-0/dashboard/)
* [Standard 1.1](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/dashboard/)
* [Standard Theme](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-theme/dashboard/) - containing the documentation theme
* [CoVE](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/cove/dashboard/) - containing the text for the the validator

## Languages

We currently actively maintain translations to:

* Spanish
* French

A number of other community translations exist in various levels of completion.

### Translation glossary

A translation glossary is [available](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/glossary/en/) (change the language code at the end of the URL to view the glossary in different languages). It can also be accessed from within the translation editor.

The glossary contains key technical terms in open contracting that must be translated carefully.

In our translation process, we encourage translators to:

1. Populate the glossary with suggested translations of its terms
1. Validate the translations with the nominated reviewer
1. Translate the rest of the documentation

### What not to translate

Some titles and descriptions of codes are copied from external sources and should be translated by those sources, not OCDS. These are tagged as `should_be_translated_upstream` and indicated by a small tag icon.
