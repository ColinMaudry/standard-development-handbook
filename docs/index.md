OCDS: Standard Development Handbook
====================================

This is the stub for a handbook that will document:

* The process for developing and maintaining the Open Contracting Data Standard;
* The software and tools that support this; 

For documentation of the Open Contracting Data Standard itself see http://standard.open-contracting.org/ 

Our process is to:

* Document how things currently work;
* Review what needs to improve;
* Make the improvement;
* Update the documentation.

Next steps:

* [ ] Developing a style guide for this handbook;
* [ ] Developing the table of contents / outline for this handbook;
* [ ] Start writing documentation.


## Draft table of contents

* **Staging** - Steps involved in staging a new version of the standard
* **Deployment** - steps involved in deploying a new version of the standard
