OCDS: Standard Development Handbook
====================================

This handbook documents and provide guidance for:

* The process for developing and maintaining the Open Contracting Data Standard
* The software and tools that support the standard

For documentation on the Open Contracting Data Standard itself see [http://standard.open-contracting.org/](http://standard.open-contracting.org/)

Our process is to:

* Document how things currently work;
* Review what needs to improve;
* Make the improvement;
* Update the documentation.

Next steps:

* [ ] Developing a style guide for this handbook;
* [ ] Developing the table of contents / outline for this handbook;
* [ ] Start writing documentation.
