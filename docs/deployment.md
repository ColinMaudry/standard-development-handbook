# Deployment

The section describes the steps involved in deploying an updated version of the standard to become the live version.

This process is used for major, minor and patch upgrades.

## (1) Freeze extensions

Each release of the standard should pin to specific versions of each **core** extension. Community extensions are not pinned. 

This is currently achieved by:

* Creating a tagged release of each extension;
* Creating a tagged release of the extension registry that points to these specific versions;
* Setting the documentation build process to refer to the relevant extension registry tag;
